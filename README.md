Training and evaluation scripts used in my work 
"COMPRESSING BERT 25 TIMES BY RNN IN NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION TASK" 
for student session of Dialog 2022 conference.
Uses https://github.com/iluvvatar/research-ml-pipeline

Initially I didn't plan to publish this scripts, because they being changed
while experiments and require refactoring. So after that work base library 
https://github.com/iluvvatar/research-ml-pipeline has been changed. I tried to
adapt this scripts for last version on this moment but don't guarantee that all
scripts work as expected.

To use:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
